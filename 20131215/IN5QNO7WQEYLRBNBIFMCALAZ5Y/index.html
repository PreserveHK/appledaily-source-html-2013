Among the French prisoners taken was General Bernier, who in the desperate struggle that was taking place would have been killed if Corporal Mackay, a Highlander, had not intervened.<br>The gratified general offered his purse to Mackay, who, however, refused the gift. Struck with astonishment, Bernier said to Colonel Pack, "What manner of man is this, who saves my life and refuses my money?" To this inquiry, Colonel Pack said, "Sir, we are British soldiers, not plunderers."<br>Corporal Mackay's noble conduct did not go unrewarded. The Duke of Wellington at once promoted him to the rank of sergeant, and the Highland Society presented him with a gold medal.<br>一八零八年輝美里亞之役，法軍遭英軍擊敗。淪為俘虜的法國將士，包括貝尼耶將軍。戰爭正酣時，貝尼耶幸得蘇格蘭裔的麥凱下士相救，才沒遭毒手。<br>貝尼耶十分感激，把錢包送與麥凱，但麥凱不肯接受。貝尼耶十分驚訝，問帕克上校說：「這是個什麼樣的人，救了我性命，卻不肯收我的錢？」帕克上校回答說：「將軍，我們是英國軍人，不是強盜。」<br>麥凱下士的高尚行為，沒有埋沒而不獲獎賞。威靈頓公爵馬上把他擢升為中士，而蘇格蘭高地會也贈他一枚金章。</p></body></html>
