A ship scuttled in the shallow water behind the beachhead sheltered at least one Japanese sniper. When the marines tried to get him, he hid himself so well that eventually the marines had to release two Dobermans.* The dogs flushed him out in less than five minutes.<br>Some marines tried to augment their monotonous diet by shooting, cooking, and eating chickens on the island. One marine remembered taking careful aim at a chicken with a captured Japanese pistol. The gun made a puff of smoke. The bullet travelled seven to eight feet and then fell. "I was grateful I didn't have to fire that pistol at the enemy," said the marine.<br>一九四五年二月，美國海軍陸戰隊登陸日軍扼守的硫磺島。灘頭陣地後面淺水處，有一艘鑿沉了的船，至少一個日本狙擊手藏身其中。海軍陸戰隊員要抓他，但他躲得十分隱蔽，眾人沒法，最後放出兩隻多伯曼犬*，不過五分鐘，就把那狙擊手趕出來。<br>有些海軍陸戰隊員嫌軍糧太過簡單乏味，會射殺島上的雞烹吃，添點口福。一個隊員記得用一把奪來的日本手槍，瞄準一隻雞。手槍冒出一陣煙，子彈飛出七、八英尺，就落在地上。他說：「幸而我不必用那把手槍向敵人開火。」<br>✽二十世紀初，德國人多伯曼使野狗雜交，務求培育出最兇猛的狗。世人因稱這種狗為多伯曼犬。</p></body></html>
