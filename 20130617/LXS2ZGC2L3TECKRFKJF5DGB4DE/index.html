But not everyone rolled out the welcome carpet, as the following account by American soldiers shows.<br>We took one little town in Normandy. When we were going down the main street (our tank was second or third), I saw a woman lean out with a gun to shoot the tank commander in front of us. I shot her with my rifle, and watched her fall out of the window.<br>Most of the wells throughout the area carried skull-and-crossbones signs. When we came along, the civilians would run out to take away the signs and assure us that the water was safe. They had marked all the wells as poisoned to worry the Germans.<br>一九四五年六月六日，盟軍登陸諾曼第，開始向巴黎進發。但也有人不歡迎他們。從以下美國軍人的敍述，可見一斑。<br>我們攻佔了諾曼第一個小鎮，沿大街前進，我那輛坦克車，是走在前面的第二、三輛。我看見一個女人拿着槍，探身窗外，要射殺我前面那輛坦克車的指揮官。我用來福槍把她打死，看着她從窗口掉到街上。<br>當地的井，多數有「骷髏頭和交叉骨」標記。我們經過時，當地人會跑出來，把那標記除去，告訴我們說，井水絕對安全。他們在所有井上都畫個「有毒」標記，只是要嚇嚇德國人。</p><p>有料放？想收料？入嚟【蘋果互動】啦！<br>【蘋果互動】是蘋果日報與讀者緊密互動、放料及收料的聚腳地。<br> http://fb.com/AppleDailyExchange  </p></body></html>
