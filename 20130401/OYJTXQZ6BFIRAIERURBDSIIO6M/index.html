He reported on his return, "There were enough to be killed, enough to be taken prisoners, and enough to run away." This observation was prompted by the fact that the English numbered only 9,000 men, while the French had no fewer than 60,000 men.<br>In the battle, Gam, seeing his king in danger, rushed to his aid with two of his countrymen. They succeeded in saving him, but at the expense of their own lives. As they lay dying on the field, Henry V knighted the three Welshmen in gratitude for their noble service.<br>一四一五年，英王亨利五世在亞金庫特擊敗法軍。戰役中的英勇事迹，特足稱道。<br>交戰前一天，威爾斯裔上校大衛．加姆奉令偵察敵營，回報說：「敵軍人數夠多了。我們要格殺多少都有，要俘虜多少都有，而望風潰逃的，也要多少都有。」他這樣說，是因為英軍只有九千人，法軍則有至少六萬人。<br>接戰時，加姆看見亨利五世身陷險境，就和另外兩名威爾斯人衝前護駕，救了他們的國王，卻犧牲了性命。三人躺在沙場上將死時，亨利五世一一冊封為爵士，以崇德報功。</p></body></html>
