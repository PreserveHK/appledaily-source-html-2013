The quality of materials we used for fighter planes had declined so much that the engines would crack if the throttle lever were turned to full. The collection of pots and pans was totally inadequate to meet our needs. We also reclaimed materials from downed US planes.<br>I had thought that, since Japan was under such duress, the quality of American materials would have suffered as well. But the components we analysed met the normal standards, and the surface of the propellers shone brightly like silver. I won't forget the chill I felt at the strength of American production capabilities.<br>日本一個軍事工廠工人描述第二次世界大戰後期的情況。<br>戰情當時已告逆轉。我們製造戰機的材料，質素大降，以致飛行員要是把油門桿拉到盡頭，飛機引擎就會破裂。搜集到的罐、鍋等，根本不敷應用。我們還在擊落的美國飛機上，採取材料再用。<br>我本來以為，日本材料上既然捉襟見肘，美國材料的質素，應該也不會好。但我們檢驗的機件，無不符合正常標準；飛機螺旋槳的表面，像銀一樣光亮。看到美國生產力之豐厚，我心裏感到陣陣寒意，那是我不會忘記的。</p></body></html>
