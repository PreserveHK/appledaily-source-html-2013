The following is his account of the incident.<br>I felt my blood freeze because we had been told that "the rifle is a gracious gift from the Emperor. Treat it with greater value than your life." In a daze, I walked towards the tracks of the Yamanote line nearby and would have thrown myself onto the path of the oncoming train when I heard the order to assemble. I came to myself with a start, and rushing to the front of the line I told the commanding officer, "I'm very sorry, sir, but I broke the firing pin on my rifle."<br>Caught off guard, the commanding officer only said," Leave the matter to me.
