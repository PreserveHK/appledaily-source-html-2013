Washington informed them that the conduct of the English government, in condemning one of his officers to death as a rebel, compelled him to make reprisals. He told them to cast lots to decide which of the four should be hanged.<br>The fatal lot was drawn by Captain Asgill, who exclaimed, "I knew how it would be; I never won so much as a hit at backgammon in my life!" Greville was asked by the other two officers to sit up with Asgill, under the pretext of companionship, but in reality to prevent him from escaping and leaving the honour among the remaining three. What he said to comfort Asgill was: "Damn it, old fellow, never mind!"<br>美國獨立戰爭期間，格雷維爾上校和另外三個軍官遭美軍俘虜。華盛頓告訴他們說，英國政府以「造反」罪名，判處一美軍軍官死刑，因此，他不得不報復，並叫四人抽籤決定哪一個須上絞首臺。<br>阿斯吉爾上尉抽到死亡之籤，歎道：「我早知如此。即使是玩雙陸棋遊戲，我都從來沒勝過一局。」其他兩名軍官請格雷維爾和阿斯吉爾一起坐到天明，說是陪伴他，其實是防他逃走，把上絞首臺的榮譽留給餘下三人。格雷維爾安慰阿斯吉爾說：「他媽的，老兄，有什麼要緊！」</p></body></html>
