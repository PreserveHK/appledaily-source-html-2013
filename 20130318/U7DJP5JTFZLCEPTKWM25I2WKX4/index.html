Some cases were motivated by lack of normal supplies. An Indian POW in New Guinea testified that:<br>The Japanese started selecting prisoners and every day one prisoner was taken out and eaten by the soldiers. I personally saw this happen and about 100 prisoners were eaten at this place.<br>The remainder of us were taken to another spot 50 miles away. At this place, the Japanese again started selecting prisoners to eat. Those selected were taken to a hut, where their flesh was cut from their bodies while they were alive. They were then thrown into a ditch, where they later died.<br>第二次世界大戰期間，日軍以俘虜到的盟軍士兵為食。有時，這是因為缺乏正常補給。一名在新畿內亞的印度籍戰俘有以下證詞：<br>日軍開始挑選戰俘，每天帶走一人，給士兵吃。我目睹這樣的事。在這個地方，給吃掉的戰俘有一百人左右。<br>我和餘下的戰俘，被帶到五十英里以外另一個地點。在這裏，日軍又着手擇人而噬。被選中的，給帶到一間小屋裏，活生生被割下身上肌肉，然後被扔進溝壑裏，慢慢死去。<br>＊Cannibal指「食人肉的人」或「動物之食同類者」。當年哥倫布抵達西印度群島，以為島上的加勒比人（Caribs）是食人族，而西班牙語叫Caribs為Canibales。這就是cannibal一字的來源。</p></body></html>
