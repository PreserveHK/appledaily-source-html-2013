When the structure is discovered, you keep telling lies! How can Hong Kong people trust you if you tell lies as a habit? Mr. Leung, i am not asking you to resign......However, I think most Hong Kong people cannot trust you anymore. So please, do not participate in next Chief Executive election."<br>（……當時你並無說出你的大宅裏也有僭建。僭建被揭後，你卻一直說謊！香港人如何能信任你這位說謊成性的人？梁先生，我不是要求你下台……不過，我認為港人已不能再信任你。所以我懇請你不要參與下屆特首選舉。）</p></body></html>
