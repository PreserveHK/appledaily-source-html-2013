A British private, of the name of Thomas Brown, distinguished himself in the fight. After having had two horses killed under him, and lost two fingers of his left hand, he saw the enemy carrying off a British standard they had captured. He galloped after them, shot the soldier who was carrying the trophy, and having seized it and thrust it between his thigh and saddle, he fought his way back through the ranks of the enemy. He received eight cuts, which severed his nose and upper lip from his face, and two bullets hit him in the back, but he bore the colours in triumph to his comrades. He was received with three rattling cheers.＊<br>一七四三年德廷根之役，英軍擊敗法軍。戰事之中，英軍二等兵湯瑪斯．布朗英勇不凡。他胯下戰馬死了兩匹，左手二指也遭砍掉，但看見敵軍奪得一面英國軍旗而去，還是拍馬窮追，開槍打死那個手執戰利品的士兵，奪回旗幟，夾在大腿和馬鞍之間，再殺出敵人重圍。他受了八處刀傷，鼻子和上唇都給斬去，背部也中了兩顆子彈，終於得成大功，把旗幟帶回英軍陣地，同袍為他連聲喝彩三次。＊<br>＊布朗之勇，令他名播全英國，但他傷勢嚴重，德廷根一役之後，不能不解甲還鄉，獲撫恤金每年三十英鎊。他多活了不足三年，一七四六年去世。</p></body></html>
