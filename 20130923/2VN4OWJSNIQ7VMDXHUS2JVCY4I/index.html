It is neither a handsome nor agreeable flower, and it is honoured for that reason. This is how it attained that distinction:<br>Once upon a time, the Danes invaded Scotland. They did not believe in making an attack upon an enemy in the night, but on one occasion they turned aside from their usal custom. As they were creeping in the dark, one of their number stepped upon a thistle. Its sharp prickles pierced his bare foot and made him cry out in pain. His cry awakened the Scottish soldiers, and springing to their arms, they drove back the Danes with great slaughter, and so saved Scotland. From that time the thistle has been the national flower of Scotland, and the motto that goes with it is: "Touch me who dares."<br>蘇格蘭常見的紫薊是蘇格蘭人國花。紫薊花並不美麗，也不討人愛，卻因此而獲推崇。其成為國花，原來有以下一段典故：<br>從前，丹族人犯蘇格蘭。他們向來不會乘夜偷襲敵人，但有一次破例，在黑暗中悄悄前行，一人突然踩在一株紫薊上，給其尖銳的刺刺穿赤腳，痛得叫起來。這一叫，驚醒了蘇格蘭士兵。他們連忙拿起武器，把丹族人擊退，而且殺傷甚眾，蘇格蘭因此得存。從此，紫薊就成為蘇格蘭國花，相伴的一句格言是：「誰敢犯我。」</p></body></html>
