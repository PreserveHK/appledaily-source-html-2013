A soldier immediately threw himself between Napoleon and the shell, and so shielded his commander Luckily, the shell did not explode.  At the moment, forgetful of the danger, Napoleon started up, exclaiming, "Wh at a soldier!"<br>This brave man was afterwards General Dumenil, who lost a leg at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, and who was governor of Vincennes in 1814.  When the invading Russians summoned him to surrender Vincennes in that year, his laconic reply was: "Give me my leg and I will give you the place."<br>拿破崙一七九八年併吞埃及，次年進犯敍利亞，圍攻阿卡不下，侵敍軍隊無功而退。<br>攻城的時候，一枚砲彈落在戰壕裏的拿破崙跟前。一個士兵馬上撲到拿破崙和砲彈之間，保護這位指揮官，幸而砲彈沒有爆炸。當時，拿破崙忘了危險，瞿然站起，歎道：「這軍人真勇敢！」<br>這個勇敢軍人，就是後來的迪梅尼爾將軍。他一八○九年在瓦格拉姆戰役之中，失去一條腿。一八一四年，他任萬塞納長官，俄國軍隊來犯，叫他獻地投降，他的回答十分簡潔：「你們把一條腿還給我，我就獻出這個地方。」</p></body></html>
