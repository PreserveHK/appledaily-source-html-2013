Some of the Highlanders were captured by the Indians and were slowly tortured to death one by one. When the turn of the last of the group came, he said he possessed a secret by which a warrior could be rendered proof against the sharpest tomahawk.<br>He collected some herbs, and having mixed their juices with suitable incantations, smeared the compound around his neck. He then laid his head on a block, and inviting forward one of the most powerful of the Indians, asked him to strike his hardest. The Indian did as instructed, striking with such force that the Scotsman's head flew several yards from the body. The Indians were thus cheated of the pleasure of torturing him.<br>一七六四年，一個蘇格蘭步兵團在北美和印第安人交戰，有些步兵落在印第安人手上，一個個給慢慢折磨至死，輪到最後一個，那人說有秘方，戰士用了，卽使最鋒利的戰斧，都砍之不傷。<br>他採集了些藥草，唸着呪語，榨汁混和，以混和劑遍塗脖子之後，把頭放在斷頭臺一樣的板上，邀一個非常壯健的印第安人上前，囑他盡力砍下去。那印第安人如言，大力一砍，那蘇格蘭人的頭顱飛到幾碼之外，印第安人也就失去折磨他的樂趣。</p></body></html>
