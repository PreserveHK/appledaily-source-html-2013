He made up an apparently valuable convoy, consisting of elephants and camels, and sent it, with only a weak escort, within sight of a portion of the British lines. A British officer went after the convoy with his men. The British commander sent Lieutenant Colonel Stewart to warn him, but Stewart arrived only to see the officer and his men enveloped by Ali's cavalry.<br>Stewart himself was nearly killed, and he owed his life to his horse. He set the animal at a wide ravine, and landed safely on the other side. None of his pursuers dared to perform the same feat.＊<br>一七八二年，南印度邁索爾王國統治者海德．阿里巧計誘得一些入侵的英軍中伏。他安排一隊大象、駱駝，負着看來很名貴的物件，在英軍目光所及的地方走過，而護送的兵力薄弱。一英國軍官率領手下前去搶奪。英軍司令遣斯圖亞特中校去叫他小心，但斯圖亞特到達時，那軍官和他手下已遭阿里的騎兵包圍。<br>斯圖亞特自己也幾乎不免，全靠坐騎才得生還。他策馬躍過寬廣的峽谷，平安落在另一方，追兵都不敢效法。＊<br>＊斯圖亞特後來離開印度，而馬已老。他留下一筆金錢，請人代為照顧。一七九九年，斯圖亞特舊地重遊，那匹馬似乎還認得舊主人。</p></body></html>
