A war bride in Bremerhaven gave the following account.<br>At the place where our house once stood, all we found was ashes and rubble. I heard that an enemy aircraft had been shot down and pieces of the aircraft were scattered all over the area where our house had been. I saw the wreckage and in it a human torso, probably the pilot, burnt beyond recognition. They said it was a British plane. I felt nothing. My own tragedy had numbed all my feelings.<br>Later, when working in the garden, I found a human arm lying there between the dungheap and the cabbages. It was a man's arm, quite hairy. Probably what was left of one of the crew. That shocked me deeply. I reported the find to the authorities.<br>到了一九四四年，德國城市常遭盟軍猛烈轟炸。不來梅港一個戰時新娘有以下記述。<br>我們房子原本所在的地方，只餘下灰燼、瓦礫。聽說，一架敵機遭擊落，碎片散布我家遺址一帶。我見到飛機的殘骸，裏面有個人的軀幹，燒得面目無法辨認，大概是那駕駛員。據說這是架英國飛機。我毫無感觸。我自己的苦惱經歷，已經令我感情麻木。<br>後來，我到花園工作，在糞堆和捲心菜之間，找到一條手臂。那是男人的手臂，毛茸茸的，該是機上人員的遺體，令我心靈大震。我向有司報告，說找到人體殘肢。</p></body></html>
