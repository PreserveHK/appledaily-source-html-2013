I ordered three good shots to steal near to him and fire at him, but the idea disgusting me, I recalled the order.<br>The officer, in returning, passed within 100 yards of us, upon which I advanced from the wood towards him. Upon my calling, he stopped, but after looking at me, proceeded. I levelled my piece at him, but he slowly cantered away. I could have lodged a dozen balls in him, but it was not pleasant to fire at the back of a man, who was acquitting himself very coolly of his duty, so I let him alone. I am not sorry that it was only later that I learned that he was George Washington.<br>一七七七年，喬治．華盛頓險些被擒或被殺。英軍少校弗格森述說其經過。<br>叛軍一個軍官沒留意到我們，騎馬朝着我軍走來。我叫三個神射手悄悄走過去向他開火，但自己都覺得這樣做可鄙，於是收回成命。<br>那軍官回程時，在我們一百碼之內經過。我走出樹林，向他喊話，他停下來，望了我一眼，繼續前行。我用槍指着他，但他策馬緩緩向前跑。我可以在他身上打十幾個孔，但我不喜歡在人背後開槍，而且他只是在冷靜的執行任務。我於是由他離去。幸而我稍後才知道他就是喬治．華盛頓。</p></body></html>
