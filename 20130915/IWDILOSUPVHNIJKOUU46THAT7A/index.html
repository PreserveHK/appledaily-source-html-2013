The soldier had been stationed as a sentinel near the Abbey, and was suspected and tried for having fallen asleep at his post. The soldier attested his innocence and verified it by the fact of having heard the great bell on that very night strike thirteen. Several witnesses swore to having heard it as well. The soldier was acquitted. It remained a mystery as to how the mishap could occur until a mechanic solved the problem. The name of the soldier was Hatfield; he died in 1770, aged 102.<br>西敏寺那個叫「大湯姆」的鐘有一段故事。話說這個鐘有一次敲過十三下。對一個士兵來說，那絕對是幸運之聲。<br>這件事發生在威廉三世在位期間（一六八九年至一七零二年）。那士兵奉命在西敏寺附近站崗，但被懷疑當值時睡着了，因此受審。他力言自己無辜。為了證明沒有入睡，他說當晚聽到大鐘打十三下。有幾個證人發誓，也都說聽到十三響鐘聲。那士兵最後獲釋。大鐘誤鳴的原因是什麼，大家都不知道，這問題後來才由一個機械工匠找到答案。那士兵名叫哈菲爾，一七七零年去世，死時一百零二歲。</p></body></html>
