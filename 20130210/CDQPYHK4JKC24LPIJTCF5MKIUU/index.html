The district commander of the occupying Soviet forces said he wanted a young Japanese woman to clean his offices. The Japanese knew what this actually meant.

I can't possibly do it." Both sides were in tears as she agonised, but finally she answered resolutely, "I'll go." We brought over a kimono and dressed her up like a glorious bride. The Japanese association chairman escorted her to the Soviet commander. We looked after her retreating figure as our tears flowed.
