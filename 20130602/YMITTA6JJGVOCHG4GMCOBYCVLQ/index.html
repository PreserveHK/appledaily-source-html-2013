A soldier's blanket was placed under his head.  He felt the relief, and asked what it was.<br>"Only a soldier's blanket, sir." "Whose blanket is it?" "Only one of the men's, sir." "I wish to know the name of the man to whom the blanket belongs," persisted the general.<br>The information was obtained after a while: "It is Duncan Roy's, of the 42nd Regiment, sir."<br>"Then," replied the general, whose features were convulsed with agony, "see that Duncan Roy gets his blanket this very night."<br>一八零一年，英法軍隊在亞歷山大港交戰，戰後，重傷將死的英軍將領雷爾夫．阿伯克龍比須由救護員擡離戰場。救護員在他腦勺下放一張士兵的毛毯。他感到舒適一點，問那是什麼。<br>「將軍，那只是一張士兵的毛毯。」「是誰的毛毯？」「將軍，那毛毯只是個普通士兵的。」阿伯克龍比不肯罷休，說道：「我想知道毛毯主人的名字。」<br>過了一會，答案找到了：「將軍，那是鄧肯．羅伊的毛毯，他隸屬第四十二軍團。」<br>阿伯克龍比這時痛得面孔肌肉抽搐，但還是說：「記着，今晚一定要給鄧肯．羅伊一張毛毯。」</p></body></html>
