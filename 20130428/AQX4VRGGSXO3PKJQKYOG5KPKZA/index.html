It is not so; for, my good sir, if you will pay 100,000 francs, you shall be free!"<br>"My Lord," replied Guesclin, "I will never pay a less sum!" And paid he did, within a month, and went off in haste to regain for France most of the English possessions in the country, leaving the Black Prince to regret what he had done.<br>貝特朗．杜．蓋克蘭是百年戰爭初期法國最著名的戰士。一三六七年，他在納費勒戰役之中，遭英國黑王子俘虜，黑王子打算把他長期囚禁。蓋克蘭暗諷英國人不敢放虎歸山。<br>黑王子氣道：「甚麼，你以為我們害怕你勇武，不放你離去？你錯了。老兄，只要你付十萬法郎贖金，就可以恢復自由！」<br>蓋克蘭回答說：「殿下，我不會少付一個錢。」不過一個月，他就交了贖金，匆匆離去，為法國奪回大部分遭英國佔領的土地，黑王子噬臍莫及。</p></body></html>
