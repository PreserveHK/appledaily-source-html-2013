During the battle, a piper of a Scottish regiment was wounded in both legs as his corps was advancing at the charge up the rising ground.  The piper, whose name was Stuart, refused to leave the field, and propping himself up on a bank, he continued to play his comrades on.  As the first company passed him, he called out, "Gang along, my braw laddies; I canna be wi' ye fechtin' ony langer, but deil hae me if ye shall want music!"* And he blew with the full force of his lungs, thus encouraging his comrades, who against tremendous odds drove back the enemy.<br>Stuart was afterwards presented by the Highland Society with a set of pipes bearing an inscription recording his brave deed.<br>一八○八年，英軍在葡萄牙輝美里亞擊敗法軍。戰鬥期間，蘇格蘭軍團的風笛隊衝上斜坡時，一個叫斯圖爾特的風笛手兩腿受創，卻不肯退出戰場，倚着土壠，撐起身體，繼續吹笛，鼓舞同袍向前。第一連將士走過時，他高喊：「各位好兄弟，向前走！我不能再跟你們一起作戰，但除非我給魔鬼奪命，你們不會沒有我的音樂伴隨。」他盡力吹奏，同袍踴躍殺敵，法軍人數雖然遠遠比英軍多，還是被迫退卻。<br>事後，斯圖爾特獲蘇格蘭高地會贈送一套風笛，笛上刻了他這段勇敢事迹。<br>✽這是蘇格蘭語，和一般英文拼法頗有不同。</p></body></html>
