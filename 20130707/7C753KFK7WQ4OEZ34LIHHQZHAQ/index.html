Peleliu, an island blessed with caves, was held by the Japanese. Menegus remembered a nearly naked Japanese deep in the water near shore. His submerged hands were not visible to the marines who beckoned him to surrender. A marine shot him through the head when he refused to do so. As he fell backwards, the charge he was holding exploded. Mengus said, "He intended to take as many Americans as possible with him."<br>Menegus also remembered entering caves and finding decapitated bodies of Americans who surrendered. "When we saw that, we took no prisoners. The Japs defending Peleliu were veterans of the rape of Nanking. They were bad guys."<br>美軍下士喬治．梅尼格斯一九四四年參與佩萊利烏戰役。佩萊利烏島當時由日軍把守，島上多洞穴。梅尼格斯記得，近岸水深處，有一個幾乎赤裸的日本軍人。打手勢着他投降的海軍陸戰隊員，看不到他水下的雙手。一個陸戰隊員，見他不肯投降，就一槍射穿他頭顱。那軍人仰天倒下，手中炸藥同時爆炸。梅尼格斯說：「他要跟美國人同歸於盡，越多越好。」<br>梅尼格斯還記得，在島上一些洞穴裏，找到投降美軍被砍去頭顱的屍體。「我們見到這情況，對日軍就有殺無赦。島上守軍是南京大屠殺的過來人，是可惡的日本鬼。」</p></body></html>
