He was tried and condemned to death by hanging. The night before his execution, he wrote to Washington, pleading hard to be shot as an officer instead of being hanged like a criminal. The next morning, Andre, who was only 29, shaved himself and appeared cheerful. He thought his solicitation to be shot would be granted. When he came in sight of the gallows, he was shocked. "It is too much," he said, "but I pray you to bear witness that I die like a soldier." In Westminster Abbey there is a monument erected to his memory.<br>美國獨立戰爭期間，英軍少校約翰．安德烈遭華盛頓處死，其事讀之令人扼腕。<br>當時美國阿諾德將軍有意投效英軍，安德烈和他見面之後，欲往紐約，途中被擒，判處絞刑。處死前一晚，他致函華盛頓，情詞懇切，說希望像個軍官一樣槍斃，而不是像個罪犯一樣縊殺。第二天早上，只有二十九歲的安德烈刮過臉，看來心情開朗。他以為槍斃的要求會獲得首肯。到他看見絞架的時候，不禁愕然。他說：「這太過了。請各位作證，我死時表現，無愧於軍人。」今天，西敏寺還有安德烈的紀念碑。</p><p>足本收睇《亂噏24》x 楊千嬅；影帝張家輝接力上陣！<br>周一至周五《亂噏24》約定你： http://bit.ly/appletalk24 </p></body></html>
