He tells how a dying soldier cried "Long live the emperor" as he passed, and was given his epaulettes on the spot by the gratified Napoleon. A gun-carriage stuck, and wounded men were tugging at it. Napoleon jumped down from his horse, and amid tremendous cheering put his shoulder to the wheel.<br>At the beginning of a battle, Napoleon saw a battalion advancing whose chief had been suspended two or three days previously for some slight misdemeanour. The poor officer was marching in the rear ranks of his men, who adored him. Napoleon took the officer by the hand, and placed him once more at the head of his men. The effect of this was simply indescribable.<br>拿破崙僕從康斯坦的《回憶錄》，載有不少拿破崙的故事。他說，一個士兵將死，見拿破崙走過，高喊「我皇萬歲」，令拿破崙大為感動，當場獲擢升為軍官。一輛砲車卡在路上，幾個傷兵用力向前拖，拿破崙一躍下馬，在熱烈的歡呼聲中，用力推車。<br>有一場戰役剛開始，拿破崙看見一營士兵走向前方。該營營長深獲手下愛戴，兩三天之前，因小過而被暫停職務，這時正走在部隊後排。拿破崙執着這個可憐軍官的手，帶他回到前列領軍。此舉的振奮軍心效果，真是難以言喻。</p></body></html>
