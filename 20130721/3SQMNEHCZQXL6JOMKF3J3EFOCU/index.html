Allan Lafreniere, who took part in the invasion, remembered that after his landing craft dropped him off on the beach, he crawled along a terraced area with an overhanging ridge. A Japanese soldier on the ridge dropped a hand grenade, which landed next to Lafreniere's left foot and exploded. As Japanese grenades exploded upwards, Lafreniere was not hit by any shrapnel, but the noise permanently injured his left ear, which still rang 40 years later.<br>After recovering from the shock, Lafreniere crawled to the end of the terrace and looked up. He saw the Japanese soldier looking down to see what damage he had done. Asked what he did next, Lafreniere said, "Well, I shot the son of a bitch with my Tommy gun."<br>一九四五年復活節，美軍進攻沖繩島。阿倫．拉弗倫尼爾參與了這場奪島戰。他記得乘登陸艇到海灘上，伏下來，在梯形地上往前爬。那裏有一片突出的高地，一個日本兵在那高地上，擲出一枚手榴彈，落在拉弗倫尼爾左腳旁邊，隨即爆炸。日本手榴彈是向上爆的，碎片沒有擊中拉弗倫尼爾，但爆炸聲令他左耳永久受創，四十年後仍有耳鳴。<br>拉弗倫尼爾定過神來，爬到梯形地一端，擡頭看見那日本兵正往下望，想看那枚手榴彈有無殺傷。拉弗倫尼爾當時怎麼辦？他回答說：「嗯，我用湯姆槍把那雜種幹掉。」</p></body></html>
