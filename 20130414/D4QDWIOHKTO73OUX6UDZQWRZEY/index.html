Another man named Bellingham was found among the dead, and brought off living by his friends with twenty wounds.<br>The surgeons were of the opinion that both of them owed their lives to the inhumanity of those who stripped them, and to the coldness of the nights, which stopped their bleeding better than any surgeon could have done. Had they been brought off immediately after the battle, they would undoubtedly have died.<br>在戰場上過一晚，對傷者有時反而有利。<br>一六四二年埃傑山之役*，傑維斯．斯克羅普爵士身受十六處創傷，不支倒地，在戰死者之中躺了整整兩天之後，才給兒子找到。還有一個人，名叫貝靈漢，身受二十處創傷，倒在戰死者之中，給朋友發現仍然活着，把他抬走。<br>醫生認為，他們兩人得保性命，是因為有狠心者脫去他們的衣服，而寒夜止血的功效，任何醫生都無法企及。假如戰役結束之後，他們馬上被抬離戰場，那就必死無疑。<br>*埃傑山之役是第一次英國內戰（1642-46）中第一場激戰。</p></body></html>
