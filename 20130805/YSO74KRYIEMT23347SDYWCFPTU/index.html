This kind of diet is a great reducer of not only muscle and fat, but also morale, and it does not take long to soften up the toughest monkey man.<br>Thousands on islands took to the hills and jungle and cut off from supplies were forced to live on what they could find. The jungle menu soon floors them. When I landed on Bougainville, what had been a Jap soldier staggered into one of our POW camps to give himself up and get some American chow. He weighed 45 pounds. At another time 90 Japs surrendered much the same way.<br>第二次世界大戰末期，美國參謀軍士詹姆斯．皮內特寫了一篇《怎樣捉拿日本鬼》：<br>要他們吃叢林裏植物的根和漿果。這樣的食物，不但會令肌肉、脂肪劇減，還會大大削弱鬥志，不用多久，那些人樣猴子，卽使是最堅強的，都會軟弱下來。<br>群島上，數以千計日本鬼躲到山上和叢林裏。他們得不到補給，找到什麼，就得吃什麼，而那樣的叢林餐，很快就教他們吃不消。我登陸布干維島的時候，一個不成人形的日本賊兵蹣跚走進戰俘營投降，只求一點美國食物。他體重是四十五磅。又有一次，九十名日本鬼走來投降，他們的狀況也好不了多少。 </p></body></html>
