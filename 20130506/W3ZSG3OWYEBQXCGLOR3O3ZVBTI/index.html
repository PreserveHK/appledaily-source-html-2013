The siege failed, and in their retreat the French marched across the desert, wild Arabs hovering around them all the time, ready to kill any man who fell behind his companions.<br>Napoleon issued an order that every horse should be given to the service of the sick and the wounded. Soon afterwards, one of his attendants came to ask which horse he wished to reserve for himself. "Scoundrel," cried Napoleon. "Don't you know the order? Let every man marched on foot -- I first. Begone!" Accordingly, during the remainder of the march, Napoleon walked by the side of the sick and the wounded.<br>一七九九年，拿破崙繼入侵埃及之後，進攻海濱城市阿卡。守城者是土耳其軍人及其盟友英軍，法軍無法攻下，最後退卻，走過沙漠，途中不斷有兇狠的阿拉伯人徘徊左右；法國士兵落在大軍之後者，難免死在他們手上。<br>拿破崙下令，馬匹全部供傷病者代步。不久，他一名侍從走來，問他要騎哪匹馬，拿破崙喝道：「你這混蛋，沒聽到命令嗎？所有人都要步行，而第一個要步行的就是我。快滾！」他如言步行到終點，沿途一直走在傷病者身邊。</p></body></html>
