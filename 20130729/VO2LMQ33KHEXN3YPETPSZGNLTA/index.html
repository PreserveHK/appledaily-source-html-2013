The Japanese made him a supervisor of a work group.<br>Dube said the POWs were always hungry. One day, one POW spilled a few grains of rice on the dirty floor of a boxcar taking them to the work site. The POW ate the grains instead of putting them back in the container. A guard noticed the POW eating at a nonregulation time and punished him. He was forced to stand holding a bucket of water over his head until lunchtime. Then the guards placed a tube down his throat and poured the water down his stomach. Luckily, he blacked out because a guard jumped on his abdomen to force the water out.<br>一九四二年，菲律賓巴丹半島淪陷，美國參謀軍士約瑟夫．迪布成為日本俘虜。日軍要他負責監督一支勞工隊。<br>迪布說，戰俘長期吃不飽。有一天，他們乘有蓋貨車到工地，一個戰俘有幾顆飯不慎落在骯髒的車廂地板上。他把那幾顆飯吃掉，沒有放回飯盒裏。一個警衞見他在非規定的時間進食，就罰他站着，捧一桶水，高舉頭上，直到午飯時間。然後，那些警衞用一條管插進他喉嚨，把那桶水灌進他胃裏。一個警衞再跳到他肚子上，把水壓出來，幸而那戰俘熬不住，昏了過去。</p></body></html>
