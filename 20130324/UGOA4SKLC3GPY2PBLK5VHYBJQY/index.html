In the back of the truck were guards with long pieces of rope that they whipped toward us marching men. They snapped a rope at one of the marchers, caught him around the neck, and dragged him for at least 100 yards down the road. He rolled this way and that way, bumping along the gravel road until he was able to free himself from the rope. As he slowly raised his bleeding body off of the road, he screamed at them, "You bastards! I'll get even with you for this."<br>一九四二年，約七萬二千個美國和菲律賓士兵，在菲律賓遭日軍俘虜，被迫從巴丹半島徒步走往六十三英里之外的集中營。＊一個戰俘記述說：<br>步行的第二天，我看見一輛日本貨車沿路開過來，車後有些警衞手執長繩索，向我們步行者抽打。他們繩索一揮，纏住一個步行者的脖子，把他在地上拖了至少一百碼。那人左右滾動，在沙礫路上碰碰撞撞，最後才掙脫繩索，慢慢站起來，滿身鮮血。他向那些日本警衞厲聲叫道：「你們這些雜種！我會和你們算這筆帳的！」<br>＊這次長途跋涉，死於路上的戰俘估計約萬人，史稱Bataan Death March （巴丹死亡之行）。</p></body></html>
