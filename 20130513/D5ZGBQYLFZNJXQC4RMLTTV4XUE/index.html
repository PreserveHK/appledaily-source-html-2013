General Valhubert was among those who fell, being severely wounded in the thigh by a cannon ball. Some of his soldiers stopped to attend to him, but, waving to them to be gone, he exclaimed, "Remember the order of the day. You can pick me up after the victory!"<br>The gallant officer was afterwards removed from the field, but the wound proved to be mortal. He met death with tranquillity. "In an hour," he wrote to the Emperor, "I shall be no more. I do not regret life, since I have participated in a victory which will ensure you a happy reign. When you think of the brave who were devoted to your service, remember Valhubert."<br>奧斯德立茲戰役那天，拿破崙下令不要救助傷者，以免削弱軍力。受傷倒地者之中，有瓦于貝爾將軍。他大腿被砲彈擊中，傷勢十分嚴重，但看見有手下停戰來援，就揮手着他們離去，高喊：「不要忘記是日命令。奏捷之後，再來找我吧。」<br>這位勇敢的軍官，後來給擡離戰場，但傷勢太重，藥石無功。他平靜的迎接死亡，臨終上書拿破崙說：「一小時之後，僕將長辭人世。此役告捷，陛下金甌喜固，僕得與其事，實不枉此生。伏請陛下他日軫念陣亡忠勇，毋忘瓦于貝爾。」</p></body></html>
