I'm just going to ramble on and hope I get to the core of what this football club has meant to me.<br>First of all, it's a thank you to Manchester United. Not just the directors, not just the medical staff, the coaching staff, the players, the supporters. It's all of you. You have been the most fantastic experience of my life. Thank you.<br>I have been very fortunate. I've been able to manage some of the greatest players in the country, let alone Manchester United. All these players here today have represented the club in the proper way. They won the championship in a fantastic fashion. Well done to the players.<br>My retirement doesn't mean the end of my life with the club. I'll be able to now enjoy watching them rather than suffer with them.<br>But if you think about it...those last minute goals, the comebacks, even the defeats are all part of this great football club of ours. And it's been an unbelievable experience for all of us, so thank you for that.</p><p>I'd also like to remind you that we've had bad times here. The club stood by me. All my staff stood by me. The players stood by me. So your job now is to stand by our new manager. That is important.<br>Before I start blubbing I just want to pay tribute to Paul Scholes, who retires today. He's unbelievable. He's one of the greatest players this club has ever had and ever will have.<br>Paul, we wish you a good retirement. I know you'll be around. Also I'd like to say another word wishing Darren Fletcher a speedy comeback.<br>I wish the players every success in future. You know how good you are, you know the jersey you're wearing. You know what it means to everyone here. And don't ever let yourself down, the expectation is always there.<br>So I'm going home, well, I'm going inside for a while. I just want to say thank you once again to all the Ferguson family – they're all up there! Eleven grandchildren!<br>Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>我心中沒有講稿，只想跟大家說番話，希望可以講出這間球會對我的意義。<br>首先，多謝曼聯，不只是董事，不只是醫療團隊、教練、球員及球迷，而是你們所有人。你們為我寫下生命中最精采的一頁。多謝！<br>我很慶幸，可以帶領這個國家最出色的球員；他們在曼聯留下腳印。他們今日代表球會，漂亮地贏得聯賽，做得好！<br>退休不代表我跟球會的故事來到結局。我未來可以享受你們的比賽，不用承擔任何壓力。但回憶那些最後階段的入球，那些反敗為勝的戰役，甚至那些敗仗，都是這間偉大球會的一部份，也是我們所有人的難忘經歷，多謝你們。</p><p>我還要提醒大家，我們有過艱難的時間；幸得球會、職員及球員一直支持我。因此，你們現在要去支持新的領隊。這是十分重要的。<br>在我哽咽前，我想向今日退役的史高斯致敬。他是這間球會史上其中一名最偉大的球員。保羅，我希望你有個美滿的退役，我知道你未來還在這裏。另外，我想祝福費查早日康復。<br>我祝願所有球員未來一片光明，你們要知道自己是多麼出色，要知道自己身上穿着一件怎樣的球衣；你們該清楚它對在場所有人的意義。不要倒下，期望一直都在你們身上。<br>我快回家了！我會先到入面一會，但我想向家人再說一次多謝。他們都來了，11個孫兒！多謝！多謝！<br>英國《每日電訊報》</p></body></html>
