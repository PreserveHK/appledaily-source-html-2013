Among those captured was Archibald Douglas, a Scottish nobleman allied to the French. Sir William Ramsay, a fellow captive, saw Douglas and had an idea.<br>Striding up to Douglas with every appearance of indignant anger, he began to cuff him soundly. Asked what he meant by behaving in that way to a nobleman, Sir William burst into scornful laughter. "Nobleman, indeed! A scoundrelly lackey who somehow has got his master's armour. I know the rascal. Forty shillings is enough ransom for him. Off you go, sirrah, and search for your master's body."<br>And Douglas, with the crestfallen air of a detected impostor, slunk off -- to freedom.<br>一三六六年英、法普瓦捷之役，英軍大捷，俘擄者包括阿切博爾德．道格拉斯：這個蘇格蘭貴族，是法軍盟友。另一戰俘威廉．拉姆齊爵士見到他，心生一計。<br>他一副義憤填膺樣子，大步走到道格拉斯跟前，重重打他幾巴掌。英軍問他為什麼這樣對待一個貴族，他不屑的笑起來，說道：「貴族？哈哈！他只是個卑鄙奴才，不知怎樣取得主人的甲冑。我認識這個無賴。他的身價，只值四十先令。你這傢伙，快滾，去把你主人的屍體找回來。」<br>道格拉斯垂頭喪氣，像個騙子被認出一樣，悄悄溜走，重獲自由。</p></body></html>
