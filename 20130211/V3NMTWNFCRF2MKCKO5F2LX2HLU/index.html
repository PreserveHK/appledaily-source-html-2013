The attitude of my classmates changed completely. The curriculum changed to Chinese education, and we were told to give our greetings strictly in Chinese. Children threw stones at us on our way home from school.<br>One sunny day, we lined up in the schoolyard. A military officer made a speech. "The war has ended now," he said. "We must now go forward hand in hand with Japan." I waved the sun-in-the-blue sky flag almost until it shredded.<br>Our classmates' behaviour improved after this. The following year we returned to Japan. I still correspond with the friends I made in Taiwan.<br>一個日本婦人敍述她一九四五年在臺灣讀中學的遭遇。<br>日本投降之後，當地有人叫我們做日本狗。同學的態度大變。課程改用中文教學，大家還奉命只可以用中文打招呼。我們放學回家路上，遭一些兒童擲石頭。<br>有一天，陽光燦爛，我們在學校運動場列隊而立，聽一名軍官致詞。他說：「戰爭結束了。現在，我們必須和日本攜手，一起邁向未來。」我把青天白日旗幾乎搖碎了。<br>此後，同學的態度改善了。第二年，我們回到日本。我和當年結識的臺灣同學，至今仍有通信。</p></body></html>
