My legs did not want to move. On the third day, I saw water flowing from an artesian well, and after a long, hard look at the water being wasted and given the fact that there was no guard right at my side, I ran toward the well to drink. Within  a few minutes, another 10 to 15 POWs ran to the well for water. At just the same time a Japanese guard came over and started to laugh at us. The first five of us drank our fill, and when the sixth man began drinking, the guard suddenly thrust his bayonet into his neck. The man fell to his knees, gasped for breath, and died. Fear filled each of us, and we ran to get back into the marching line.<br>巴丹死亡之行路上，美國戰俘遭日軍「禁止吃喝」，一個戰俘談到這件事。<br>我胃痛喉乾，雙腳不想走動，到了第三天，看見一個噴水井。我戀戀不捨，盯着浪費的井水，又見身旁沒有警衞，就跑到井邊喝水。不過幾分鐘，井邊就跑來了十到十五個要喝水的戰俘。這時，一個日本警衞走過來，出言嘲諷。我們頭五人喝夠了，第六個開始喝，那警衞突然舉起刺刀插進他脖子。那人跪倒地上，張口喘氣，隨即一命嗚呼。<br>我們非常恐懼，連忙跑回戰俘行列，繼續前行。</p></body></html>
