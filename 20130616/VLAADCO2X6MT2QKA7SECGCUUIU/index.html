A bullet hit me in the leg, did not penetrate the bone, but still knocked me down. I had a carbine with me and returned fire while on the ground. We shot at each other until we had emptied our magazines.<br>By then I could walk again, and we went at each other with knives. He cut me twice, the second time I had let him so that I could get inside his guard. I won but have never wanted to do a repeat of that. My wounds were minor, and the corpsman was able to patch me up so I could continue with the company.<br>一名美國海軍陸戰隊員記述他一九五零至五三年韓戰中的遭遇，如下：<br>我巡邏時，一個中國士兵用自動手槍向我開火。一枚子彈打中我大腿，沒有貫穿腿骨，但還是把我擊倒。我伏在地上，用隨身的卡賓槍還擊。雙方不斷交火，直到子彈都用盡了。<br>這時，我可以站起來走路，就和那中國士兵各執小刀格鬥。他兩度把我割傷：第二次是我有心賣個破綻，乘機突破他的防衞。我雖然得勝，但實在不想再有這樣一次經歷。我受的只是輕傷，醫務員給我包紮之後，我就繼續隨連隊進退。</p><p>有料放？想收料？入嚟【蘋果互動】啦！<br>【蘋果互動】是蘋果日報與讀者緊密互動、放料及收料的聚腳地。<br> http://fb.com/AppleDailyExchange  </p></body></html>
