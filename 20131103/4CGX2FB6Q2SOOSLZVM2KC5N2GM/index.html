He judged the real cause of these immolations to be the profit derived by the priests, and determined to put an end to the practice.<br>Hearing of an intended burning of widows, Napier made it known that he would stop the sacrifice. The priests contended that all nations had customs which should be respected. Napier replied, "Be it so. This burning of widows is your custom. Prepare the funeral pile. But our English nation has also a custom. When men burn women alive we hang them, and confiscate all their property. Let us all act according to our national customs." Needless to say, no suttee took place then or afterwards.<br>一八四三年，查理．納皮爾成為西印度辛蒂省統治者，發覺當地寡婦被焚殉夫風俗甚盛。他認為，活焚殉夫的真正原因，是祭司謀利，決定杜絕這類事件。<br>於是，聽到又有寡婦要被焚，納皮爾表示會禁止。祭司抗議說，各國都有其習俗，應予尊重。納皮爾回答說：「那麼，好吧。焚燒寡婦，是你們的習俗，請準備火葬柴堆。不過，我們英國也有一個習俗，就是男人把女人活活燒死，就要問吊，所有財產也要充公。我們各自按國家習俗行事吧。」不用說，此後再也沒有寡婦被焚。</p></body></html>
