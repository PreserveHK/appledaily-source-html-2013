He was shown into the waiting room with other patients. As many of them belonged to the lower classes, and were admitted to the consulting room in turn before him, the Duke became impatient, and forced his way in without being summoned.<br>The doctor, who was busy with a patient, looked up in surprise, exclaiming, "How did you get in, sir?"<br>"By the door," was the impassive reply.<br>"Well, sir," said Abernethy, who of course recognised his visitor, "I recommend you to make your exit the same way."<br>The Duke had no alternative but to retreat.<br>威靈頓公爵打敗了拿破崙，但一個醫生卻曾經令他退卻。<br>威靈頓去看阿伯內西醫生，被帶到候診室，和其他病人一起。這些病人，不少來自低下階層，而且依次排在威靈頓之前，一一走進診症室。威靈頓很不耐煩，不待呼喚，直闖到醫生跟前。<br>阿伯內西醫生正忙着看病人，愕然擡起頭來，問道：「先生，你是怎樣走進來的？」<br>威靈頓若無其事，回答說：「從這道門走進來。」<br>阿伯內西說：「那麼，先生，請你從這道門走出去。」他當然認得來者是誰。<br>威靈頓沒奈何，只得退卻。</p></body></html>
