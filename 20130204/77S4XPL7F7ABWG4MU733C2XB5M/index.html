The military would capture several prisoners and execute them in front of a firing squad. Others were beheaded. I went with several friends to the execution spot to watch.<br>"The severed heads are out in the open," someone said. We ran to see them. Some of the faces had lips clenched in resentment. Nearby a large crowd of Chinese had gathered to see the heads. I wonder what they felt. I was quite inured to such brutality.<br>日本一個婦人記述中日戰爭期間日本人怎樣對待他們稱為「賊寇」的中國平民。她當時身在中國東北。<br>我小時住在當年的滿洲國*。軍方經常出剿賊寇，每次俘虜到幾個人，就由行刑隊槍斃，或用刀斬首。我和幾個朋友走到刑場觀看。<br>有人說：「斬下的頭顱現在公開展覽了。」我們跑過去看。一些人頭嘴唇緊咬，一臉恨意。附近有一大群中國人在觀看。我不知道他們有甚麼感想。我對那樣殘暴的行為則已司空慣見。<br>*一九三一年九月，日本關東軍發動九一八事變，攻佔中國東北三省，次年成立傀儡組織「滿洲國」。</p></body></html>
