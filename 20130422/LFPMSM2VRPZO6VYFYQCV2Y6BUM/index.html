It ended in a victory for Spain, but one of the English officers, Edward Stanley, distinguished himself by a daring action.<br>In the attack on one of the forts, which was defended by 300 Spaniards, Stanley had a pike thrust at him. With great rapidity, he seized hold of the weapon with both his hands and retained such a strong grasp that the Spaniards, unwilling to release the pike, drew him up into the fort. There the Englishman put his back to the wall, and, drawing his sword, dispersed the enemy before him. Before the Spaniards could recover from their astonishment, other English soldiers had scrambled up the works, and the fort was captured.<br>一五八六年九月二十二日聚特芬戰役，一方是獲英軍援助的荷蘭，一方是西班牙，最後西班牙獲勝，但英國軍官愛德華．斯坦利十分勇武，表現不凡。<br>當時三百西班牙人把守一個城堡。斯坦利攻城時，見一枝長矛向他插來，馬上雙手抓住矛身，緊握不放。城上西班牙人不想丟了長矛，把他拉上去，一直拉進城堡。斯坦利一到城上，就背靠城牆，拔劍擊退面前敵兵。荷蘭守軍還在錯愕之中，其他英國士兵已經攀上城牆，終於攻下城堡。</p></body></html>
