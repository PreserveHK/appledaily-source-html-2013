Though he was willing to allow a lot, this statement was too much for the duke to swallow, and he said, "I have heard you, sir, say so before; but I did not witness this marvellous charge. Your Highness must know that the French cavalry are the best in Europe."<br>英王喬治四世一八二零年至一八三零年在位。他當然沒有參與滑鐵盧戰役，但經常把這場戰役掛在口邊，似乎自己也有參戰，終於自己都以假為真。<br>他還是王子的時候，有一次和威靈頓公爵一起吃晚飯，竟然跟威靈頓說，他曾率領禁衞軍衝鋒，把內伊元帥*指揮的法國騎兵殺得一敗塗地。威靈頓不想和王子怎麼計較，但那樣的話實在教他吃不消。他說：「殿下，你從前也講過類似的話，不過，我在戰場上，沒有看見那次英勇無匹的衝鋒。殿下必須知道，法國騎兵是歐洲最精銳的騎兵。」<br>*內伊是拿破崙得力助手，驍勇善戰。</p></body></html>
