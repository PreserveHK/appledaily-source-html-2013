But he soon had good reason to change his opinion.<br>At the Battle of Porto Novo, fought between British and Indian forces in 1781, the 73rd was the regiment that won the battle against heavy odds. It led all the chief attacks on the enemy, and General Coote's attention was specially attracted to the pipers, who always blew the hardest when the enemy's fire was hottest. This so pleased the general that he called out, "Well done, my brave fellows, you shall have a set of silver pipes for this." He was as good as his word, for he gave the men a sum of money, with which they bought the new instruments.<br>一七七八年，第七十三蘇格蘭高地軍團在印度。當時，艾爾．庫特將軍認為，軍團的風笛無非「野蠻時代遺留的廢物」。但是，他不久就得改變看法。<br>一七八一年，英軍和印度軍隊在波多諾伏交戰，第七十三軍團以寡敵眾，打了勝仗。英軍主要的攻勢，都由這軍團發動。軍團風笛手的表現，更令庫特將軍刮目相看。他們在敵軍槍火最猛烈的時候，把風笛吹得最為響亮。庫特將軍高興得喊道：「真勇敢，做得好！你們會有一套銀笛作獎賞。」他沒有食言，果然出錢給軍團買了新風笛。</p></body></html>
