He saw at once the state of matters. With one hand he drew his dirk, and grasping the American's throat with the other, threatened to stab him to the heart if he did not bear him back to the British camp. The American hastened to comply with the order. When the British commander learned what had happened, he was much amused, and gave the American his liberty.<br>一七七七年，在和美國叛軍一場小戰之中，麥格雷戈中士重傷倒地，不省人事。他當時身穿有銀色花邊的新夾克，有大個銀釦環的昂貴鞋子，還戴着一個頗值錢的手錶，引起一名美國士兵注意。那士兵把他背起來，準備走離戰場，慢慢脫下他的衣物。<br>連串的晃動，很快令麥格雷戈醒過來。他馬上明白發生了什麼事，一手拔出短刀，一手揑着那美國士兵喉嚨，要那士兵送他回英軍軍營，否則就一刀直插心臟。那士兵連忙聽命。英國指揮官聽到這件事，覺得很有趣，把那美國士兵放了。</p></body></html>
