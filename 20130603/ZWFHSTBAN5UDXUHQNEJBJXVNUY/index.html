In 1298, he was defeated and captured by Edward I of England. His trial took place in the great hall at Westminster. Impeached of treason, he replied that he was never traitor to the King of England, for he never acknowledged fealty to Edward. He was sentenced to death.<br>On 23 August 1305, Wallace was dragged at the tails of horses to the place of execution. He was hanged on a high gallows, and while he still breathed his bowels were taken out and burnt before his face.<br>His head was then cut off, and set up on a pole on London Bridge. His right arm was sent for exhibition at Newcastle, his left to Berwick, his right foot to Perth, and his left to Aberdeen.<br>威廉．華利士是一二九零年代反抗英國統治的蘇格蘭英雄，一二九八年，被英王愛德華一世擊敗，淪為階下囚，給送到西敏寺大堂審訊，罪名是叛國。他回答說，從來沒有背叛英國國王，因為他從來沒有向愛德華效忠。他被判處死刑。<br>一三零五年八月二十三日，華利士給拖在馬匹之後，直拖到刑場，吊在矗立的絞架上，還未斷氣，內臟就給挖出來，在他面前焚燒。<br>然後，他的頭被斬下，掛在倫敦橋一條長桿上，右手送到紐加塞示眾，左手送到貝里克，右腿送到珀斯，左腿則送到亞伯丁。</p></body></html>
