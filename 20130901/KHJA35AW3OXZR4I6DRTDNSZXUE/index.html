When young and engaged in one of his first battles, he saw a drummer at his side killed by a cannonball, which scattered the poor lad's brains in every direction. Townshend's eyes were at once fixed on the ghastly object, which seemed to engross his thoughts. A superior officer supposed he was intimidated at the sight, and addressed him in a manner calculated to cheer his spirits.<br>"Oh," said Townshend with calmness but severity, "I am not frightened. I am puzzled to make out＊ how any man with such a quantity of brains ever came to be here."<br>喬治．湯森德生於一七二四年，卒於一八○七年，是英國著名軍人，官至陸軍元帥。他年輕的時候，未慣戰陣，戰場上看見身旁一個年輕鼓手不幸給砲彈擊中身亡，腦漿四迸。他瞪着那恐怖的腦漿，若有所思。一個高級軍官以為他給這情景嚇怕了，就以鼓舞的語氣教他振作。<br>湯森德平靜而嚴肅的回答：「啊，我不是害怕，只是感到奇怪，不明白腦袋這麼發達的人，怎麼會來到這樣的地方。」<br>＊Make out是「了解」、「懂得」的意思，例如：He is so reserved a man that I just can't make him out（他是個非常沉默寡言的人，我完全無法了解他）。</p></body></html>
