In the Battle of Saipan in 1944, he manned a machine gun when the Japanese staged a strong counterattack. After the counterattack was stopped, the order to cease firing was issued. But Sirois kept firing at 10 enemy soldiers 300 yards away, and hit a few. His corporal began reprimanding him, but the commanding officer came over and congratulated him for a job well done.<br>The next day, Sirois volunteered to take part in the mopping-up operations. He found a foxhole with four Japanese crouched inside, and killed all four. Unfortunately, one bullet bounced back, hitting him in the knee.<br>第二次世界大戰期間，約瑟夫．西羅伊斯原在夏威夷任膳食軍士，卻要求降職為二等兵，以便上陣殺敵。一九四四年塞班島之役，日軍一度大舉反攻。西羅伊斯任機槍手，到日軍攻勢停止之後，仍然不理停火命令，向三百碼之外十個敵軍開火，擊中了幾個。他隸屬的陸軍下士責他不聽號令，但軍隊指揮官卻走過來，稱讚他做得好。<br>第二天，西羅伊斯請纓參與掃蕩行動。他找到一個散兵坑，裏面蹲着四個日軍，就把四人射殺。可惜一顆子彈反彈回來，擊中他膝蓋。</p></body></html>
