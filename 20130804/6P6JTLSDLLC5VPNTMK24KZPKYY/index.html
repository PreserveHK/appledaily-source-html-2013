He also destroyed a large food warehouse and scored a near miss on the centre of a gun emplacement that tipped the gun out of position, rendering it useless. The navy was thus able to rescue the downed airmen.<br>Tremblay was awarded the Air Medal for this heroic deed.<br>埃利．特倫布萊是美軍戰鬥機飛行員，十分勇敢，一九四四年，在日本領海，協助救回被擊落的戰機同袍。<br>他看見同袍正被浪濤沖往日本海岸，有被俘虜之虞，而趕去救援的驅逐艦，在日本沿岸大砲轟擊之下，險象環生。他於是冒着猛烈的防空砲火，駕飛機盡可能低飛，向日本砲臺掃射，摧毀了一個臨時貯油庫和一個大糧倉，並差點擊中一個砲臺的中心部分，使大砲傾側，不能再發射。海軍因此得以救起被擊落的飛行員。<br>特倫布萊由於作戰英勇，獲頒飛行勳章。</p></body></html>
