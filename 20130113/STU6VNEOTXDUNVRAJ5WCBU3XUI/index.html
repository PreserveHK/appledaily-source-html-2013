On their way, they were spat upon and called names by peasants who had suffered all sorts of violence from the Japanese, from pillaging to rape. One of them recounted what happened when they went through a small village.<br>Our belongings were looted by the local peasants, and stones were thrown at us. Just then some Eighth Route Communist Army soldiers appeared. They drove away the peasants, and retrieved our belongings from them. They escorted us until we arrived at our quarters for the night. Then their commander said, "I hope you will return to Japan safely as soon as possible." With these words, he disappeared into the night. He was unmistakably a Japanese.<br>一九四六年一月，華北一群日本人徒步望青島撤退，沿途遭農民吐口水和咒駡：這些農民曾經受盡日人暴力欺凌，包括強搶、強姦。一名日本人憶述經過一個小村莊的遭遇。<br>當地農民搶去我們的財物，還向我們擲石頭。就在這個時候，第八路共軍一些士兵出現了。他們把農民趕走，給我們奪回財物，並護送我們到當晚下榻的地方。他們的指揮官說：「希望各位盡快安全回到日本。」說罷，就消失在夜色裏。他毫無疑問是個日本人。</p></body></html>
