The sergeant's charming manner attracted the notice of Colonel Wangenheim, who was from Hanover. He had the sergeant treated with care and kindness until he was exchanged.<br>Twenty years later, the French under Marshal Bernadotte occupied Hanover. Wangenheim, now a general, went to see Bernadotte. "Do you remember a wounded sergeant whom you took under your protection in 1783?" Bernadotte asked.<br>Wangenheim replied that he certainly did. "That young sergeant," said Bernadotte, "is the same person who has now the honour of entertaining you, and who is happy to acknowledge here publicly all that he owes to you!"<br>一七八三年，法軍在南印度和英軍小戰一場，有些傷兵落在英軍手上，其中一個年輕中尉，舉止大方，獲得來自漢諾威的旺根海姆上校青眼。旺根海姆叫人好好照顧他。後來兩軍交換戰俘，那中尉獲釋離去。<br>二十年之後，法國陸軍元帥伯納多特率軍進據漢諾威。旺根海姆這時已擢升為將軍，前去見他。伯納多特問他說：「你記不記得，一七八三年，你曾經照顧一個受傷的中尉？」旺根海姆說當然記得。伯納多特說：「那年輕的中尉，就是現在有幸款待你的伯納多特。我希望大家知道你對我的大恩大德。」</p></body></html>
