The regiment was composed of young men who had never been in action before, and the check threw them into disorder.<br>Seeing this, Colonel Doyle galloped to the front, rallied his men, and ordering the buglers to strike up "Ca Ira", he said, "Come on, lads!  We'll beat them to their own damned tune!"  A brilliant charge was the result, the French battery was captured, and in the end Famars was rushed and taken. The loss of the regiment was comparatively slight.<br>一七九三年法馬斯之役，法軍與英國、奧地利、漢諾威聯軍交鋒。法軍在喇叭手吹奏法蘭西共和國樂曲《必能如願》聲中，擊退一英國軍團，那軍團的士兵都很年輕，無非初次上陣，遭擊退之後，陣腳大亂。<br>多伊爾上校看見這個情況，策馬跑到前線，重整旗鼓，叫喇叭手也奏起《必能如願》，說道：「小夥子，振作起來，我們要在他們媽的那首樂曲聲中，把他們打敗。」軍團奮力衝殺，奪得法軍的砲臺。最後，法馬斯也在猛攻之下，落入聯軍手上。那個英國軍團的傷亡人數，和戰役裏其他軍隊相比，並不算多。</p></body></html>
