His dog, a white one of the poodle kind, finding that its master had not returned from the battle, set out in search of him, and found him at night in his dreary resting place. It expressed its affection by moans, and by licking the dying general's hands and face. When the general died, the dog attached itself closely to the body, and for three days refused to eat.<br>When the general was buried, the dog lay down upon the earth which covered the body, and by silence and deep dejection evinced its sorrow. General Graham saw the little mourner, and at once adopted it as his own. It remained with its new master until its death many years later.<br>一八一一年巴羅薩戰役結束，一個重傷將死的法軍將領給遺留戰場上。他養的白色獅子狗見主人沒有回來，就跑去找他，到了晚上，終於找到主人的淒涼歇息地。牠一邊悲鳴，一邊舔垂死主人的手和臉，顯示了對主人的深情，到主人去世，又緊依其屍體，三天不肯進食。<br>那將領下葬之後，這隻獅子狗伏在掩埋屍體的泥土上，不聲不響，神情委靡，哀傷之情可掬。格雷姆將軍見到這小狗為主人守喪，毫不猶豫就收養了牠。這隻狗跟隨新主人多年之後才去世。</p></body></html>
