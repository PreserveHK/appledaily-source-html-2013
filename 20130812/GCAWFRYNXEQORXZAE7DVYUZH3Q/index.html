One hundred soldiers rounded up all the white people.<br>In February 1942, American ships bombarded Tarawa. One prisoner tried to swim to one of the ships but was quickly captured. The Japanese slit his calf muscles from the knees to the ankles to prevent further escape attempts. Some of the prisoners cheered when the ships attacked. The Japanese took 22 of them, tied them to trees, and bayoneted them. Their bodies were beheaded and burned.<br>The Americans wrested Tarawa during a fierce four-day battle in 1943. American casualties totalled 3,500 killed and wounded. The Japanese lost most of their garrison, about 5,000 men. Only 17 were wounded and captured.<br>一九四一年十二月十日，即珍珠港遇襲之後不過幾天，日軍登陸塔拉瓦：那是吉爾貝特群島之中一個環狀珊瑚島。一百個士兵，把島上白人全部拘捕。<br>一九四二年二月，美國戰艦砲轟塔拉瓦。一個俘虜想游泳逃往戰艦，但日軍迅速把他抓回，為防止他再次逃跑，就把他小腿肚的肌肉由膝至踝割開。有些俘虜見美艦來攻，不禁歡呼，日軍就把其中二十二人揪出來，縛在樹上，用刺刀捅死，然後斬首，火燒屍體。<br>一九四三年，美軍經四日激戰，死傷約三千五百人，奪下塔拉瓦。日本約五千駐軍則幾乎全部灰飛煙滅，只有十七人受傷被擒。</p></body></html>
