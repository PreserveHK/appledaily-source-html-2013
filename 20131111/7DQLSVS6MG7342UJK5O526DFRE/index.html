Napier thought there was some collusion between the juggler and his assistant, believing that it was impossible to divide by a sweep of the sword so small an object on a man's hand without touching the flesh. He offered his own hand for the experiment. The juggler declined.<br>"I thought I should find you out," enclaimed Napier triumphantly. The juggler then said, "If you will hold your arm steady, I will perform the feat." Napier was frightened, but he could not back down before his staff. He put the lemon on his hand, and held out his arm. With a swift stroke, the juggler cut the lemon in two pieces.<br>英國將領納皮爾爵士（一八零九年生，一八五三年卒）有一次在印度看見一雜技師一揮劍，就把助手掌上放的一個檸檬斬成兩半。他懷疑兩人串謀使手腳，不相信可以把掌上那麼小的物件一劍劈開，而不觸及皮肉。他伸出手，叫那雜技師再試試，那雜技師婉言拒絕。<br>納皮爾得意洋洋，說道：「我早就料到可以揭露你的把戲。」那雜技師於是說：「你的手只要不動，我就試給你看。」納皮爾心裏害怕，但在手下面前，不能退縮，惟有把檸檬放在掌上，伸出手。那雜技師運劍如風，把檸檬劈成兩半。</p></body></html>
