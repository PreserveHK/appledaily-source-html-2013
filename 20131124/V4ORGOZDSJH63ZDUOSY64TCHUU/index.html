To escape, he had to go along the front of the British line, within musket range.  He took the risk, and although a whole brigade fired at him, both man and horse escaped with impunity.<br>And at the siege of Yorktown, British soldiers had each three bags of sand to cover themselves from the enemy's aim.  Two of these were placed with their ends at a little distance from each other, and the third crossed over the interval, leaving a small hole for the soldiers to fire through.  The American riflemen, however, were so expert that, on seeing a piece protruded through the hole, they levelled towards it, and frequently shot the men through the head.<br>美國獨立戰爭一場戰事之中，一個騎着馬的美國軍官勢將被擒，要脫身，必須在英軍陣前走過，而且是在英軍毛瑟槍射程之內。他冒險策馬向前。一旅英軍一起向他開火，卻都沒有打中，人馬安然逃脫。<br>而在約克敦圍城戰之中，每個英軍士兵都有三個沙包，防禦敵軍槍火。他們左右各放一個沙包，兩個沙包的一端幾乎相接，第三個沙包則放在兩者之間，只留下一個小孔，從這個小孔開槍。但美軍的來福槍手十分厲害，看見有槍管從小孔伸出來，就瞄準小孔開槍，每每射穿英軍士兵的頭顱。</p></body></html>
