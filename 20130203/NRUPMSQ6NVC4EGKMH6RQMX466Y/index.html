But the US was prepared for the attack, and inflicted a crushing defeat on the invaders. A Japanese who took part in the battle later wrote:<br>As the enemy's machine-gun fire burst on the deck, my legs shook violently. Turning my eyes to the distance, I saw black smoke rising here and there, indicating the great damage suffered by our warships. My ship received orders to retreat.<br>The following morning, there was a burial at sea. A casket wrapped in military colours was lowered into the sea. It did not sink for quite a while, and we saw it drifting farther and farther away, in and out of the waves.<br>一九四二年六月，日軍計劃奪去美國太平洋艦隊一個重要的燃油補給站，派遣一百六十二艘戰艦，前去攻佔中途島。但美軍早有防備，把來犯者殺得落花流水。一個參戰的日本人事後寫道：<br>敵軍的機關槍火打在甲板上，我雙腿抖得非常厲害。往遠處望去，只見黑煙四起，我們那些戰艦所受損毀顯然非常嚴重。我的戰艦奉命撤退。<br>第二天早上，我們舉行海葬。一副棺材用軍旗包着，放進海裏，好一段時間都沒有沉下去，波浪之中載浮載沉，在我們目送之下，漸漂漸遠。</p></body></html>
