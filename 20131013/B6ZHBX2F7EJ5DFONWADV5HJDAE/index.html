But before he could withdraw it he was bayoneted through the jaw. Staggering back, he shot the man who had dealt the blow.<br>Two other Russians then fought him. He knocked down one of them, who clutched his leg as he fought the other man. Bancroft killed the man on the ground by kicks with the heel of the boot, and the other with the bayonet. An English officer, not perceiving that the Russian on the ground was trying to hold Bancroft till the other Russian could stab him, shouted out, forbidding him to kick "a man that is down".<br>以下故事，見伊夫林．伍德的克里米亞戰爭回憶錄。那是十九世紀中葉英、俄之戰。<br>二等兵詹姆斯．班克羅夫衝入敵陣，用刺刀捅穿眼前一個敵兵的胸膛，但刺刀還未拔出，下顎已被敵人刺刀捅了個窟窿。他站不穩，倒退幾步，開槍把傷他者打死。<br>另外兩個俄國士兵隨即上前跟他格鬥，一個給他擊倒地上，抱着他的腿，另一個則和他交手。班克羅夫用靴的後跟把地上那人踢死，又用刺刀把另外那人殺死。一個英國軍官不知道地上那俄國人抱着班克羅夫，是要方便另外那個俄國人下殺手，還高聲叫班克羅夫不要「乘人之危」踢地上那俄國士兵。</p></body></html>
