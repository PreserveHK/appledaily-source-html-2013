The British governor of the island, a man named Hodge, had only a force of 22 men. Assembling  his little band, he said, "Gentlemen, I am an utter stranger to all manner of military discipline, so have nothing to recommend to you but load and fire as fast as you can, and stand by one another. So God bless you." The men shook hands, and bound themselves to either drive the French away, or die in the attempt.<br>They attacked the enemy in a narrow path from behind a breastwork, and killed or wounded over 100 of them. The French had to retreat, board their vessels, and leave. Governor Hodge had not a man of his 22 killed or wounded.<br>一七四五年，法國一支小艦隊開到英治西印度群島的安圭拉小島，派遣六百五十人登陸，要從英國手上把島奪過來。島上總督霍奇召集手下僅有的二十二人，對他們說：「各位，我對軍事一無所知，除了請你們對敵時盡快裝子彈、開槍，互相支持，沒有其他指示了。願上帝保佑你們。」那二十二人互相握手，發誓不是擊退法軍，就是戰死。<br>他們在一條小徑迎敵，藏身一道胸牆之後，把法軍打死打傷百多人。法軍不得不撤退，登船離去。霍奇總督手下二十二人，沒有一個死傷。</p></body></html>
