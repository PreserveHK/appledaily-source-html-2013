Other prisoners were tied together, thrown into pits, doused with gasoline, and set on fire. In one game, the Chinese were driven to the top storeys of buildings, the stairs were removed, and the buildings were incinerated. Still others were buried up to their waist and ripped apart by German shepherd dogs.<br>And the Japanese did not forget to take photographs. There were photographs of Japanese soldiers in the act of raping Chinese women and Japanese soldiers tearing the clothes off young girls.<br>南京大屠殺期間，日軍玩得十分痛快，從以下記載可見一斑。<br>中國公民有些被釘在木板上，供坦克車輾過；有些給釘在樹上或電線桿上，像釘十字架一樣；有些給剝去大片皮膚；有些給挖去眼睛或割去鼻子、耳朵，然後才殺卻。還有些俘虜被縛在一起，拋進坑裏，淋以汽油，然後放火燃燒。有一場遊戲是這樣玩的：中國人給趕到建築物最高層，然後拆去樓梯，再向建築物縱火。又有些俘虜下半身給埋在土中，再放德國牧羊犬把他們咬死。<br>此外，日軍沒有忘記攝影，拍了不少日軍強姦中國婦女、撕破中國少女衣服的照片。</p></body></html>
