A noncomissioned flight technician on the flight deck gave the following account.<br>When the seawater reached our ankles, the executive officer on the bridge ordered, "601 Squadron airmen abandon ship!" Reporting to the executive officer, I ordered the men, "Head for the destroyer Wakasuki straight ahead. Do your best."<br>We were about to jump into the sea when four of the men surrounded me, saying, "I can't swim." "You don't have to swim, just stay afloat," I said. "Pieces of lumber and tatami mats for judo will come drifting by. Lifeboats will come by as well, so hang on." But I did not have the nerve to ask them if they could float.<br>一九四四年六月，日本航空母艦翔鶴號被美國潛艇發射的三枚魚雷擊中。當時在飛行甲板上的一名技術軍士有以下記述。<br>海水淹到我們腳踝。船橋上的副艦長下令：「六零一飛行中隊飛行員棄船！」我是向副艦長負責的，就命令各飛行員：「游到前面的若月號驅逐艦那裏。盡力而為吧。」<br>我們正要跳進海裏，四個飛行員圍着我說：「我不會游泳。」我說：「你們不必游泳，浮在水上就可以。木塊、柔道場的稻草墊等，會漂到你們身旁。救生艇也會漂過。撑住吧。」但我沒有勇氣問他們能不能浮在水上。</p></body></html>
